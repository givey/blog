<p>Want to understand your personal giving or the giving behaviour of clients/companies you work with?</p><p>The Centre for Venture Philanthropy of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation  has been studying Giving behaviours and have devised a two-sided wheel to assess different types of motivation and investment decisions.</p><p>The first is below; take a look at the sdifferent broad categories of style of giving, and see which you most clearly identify with and where you sit on the spectrum. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="722" data-orig-width="870"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/66094604905c0438514b10655c710497/tumblr_inline_nwvj9bv0Pj1rbfms4_540.png" data-orig-height="722" data-orig-width="870"/></figure><p>The second side is all about investment; whether that is financial or time based. By blending these two sides of the wheel, you’ll get a feel for your giving behaviour and a deeper understanding of your motives and restrictions.</p><p><br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="687" data-orig-width="738"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/534e6ec44b8dc47774d22a6cfe0fcd29/tumblr_inline_nwvlzg4wUc1rbfms4_540.png" data-orig-height="687" data-orig-width="738"/></figure><p>Credit: <a href="http://ukcommunityfoundations.org/philanthropy_services/philanthrophy_wheel/" target="_blank">UK Community Foundations</a> </p>
