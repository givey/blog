<p><b>&rsquo;</b>Projects’ are registered or non-registered organisations, groups of people or individuals from anywhere around the world to fund the ideas that will help others, and are a place to support new and emerging ideas that are designed to help others.<br/></p><p>If you are a project, or are aspiring to create one, here are a few tips and tricks to get you off the ground:</p><ul><li>Your supporters are keen to hear how you&rsquo;re getting on and what they&rsquo;ve helped to achieve, and we would love to share your project updates in real time! Keep them updated by creating a new share every time you post a new video, have some great photographs to share, or write a new blog post or article.</li><li>Every week, we send our highlights to 30,000+ users. If you&rsquo;d like to be considered, drop us a line with a short description of your project and a high resolution photo. After all, &lsquo;a picture is worth a thousand words&rsquo; and content is really key!</li><li>Move your project forward by setting your social media on fire! It’s time to call in those favours, and let those friends in high places know that you would appreciate their promotion to help.</li><li>Did you know? If you have a website you provide a direct link to your Givey project page? Send us a request to <a href="mailto:projects@givey.com" target="_blank">projects@givey.com</a> and we’ll fire over the widgets and logos you need.</li></ul><p>Be expectant! Compassionate problem solving is not easy, but we have your back and want to help you to achieve your goals. Below shows a snippet of how just one piece of great promotion for your project can have a great impact, just like it did for One Wave!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="267" data-orig-width="598"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/a546af5df8b113e71759f105bc5c7d5f/tumblr_inline_ntbopySi4n1rbfms4_540.png" data-orig-height="267" data-orig-width="598"/></figure><p>​​​Explore ‘Projects’ for more information and from all of us here, enjoy funding your ideas and helping to solve some the world&rsquo;s problems - we think that&rsquo;s a pretty special thing to be a part of.​</p>
