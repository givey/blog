<p>(just in case you missed the email! Press Release to follow)</p><h2><b>“</b>Having processed over £1m in donations for our 8,000 UK charities, we are very excited to announce that it is time for Givey to expand to fulfil our mission of helping others and make giving a genuine habit!</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve seen huge success through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3o117otQFo" target="_blank">Solvey Project</a>, an initiative launched to help projects voice their ideas and create solutions for those in need, and we are proud to announce we will soon be providing the vetting and payments system to anyone globally who wants to solve a problem for others. We will allow any group or organisation that wishes to help others use our unique content donation mechanism, the Givey Share, to raise the funds they need to alleviate some of the world&rsquo;s most prominent crises and concerns. Givey will expand to include non-UK registered charities, and these will be called Givey &lsquo;Projects&rsquo;.</p><figure data-orig-width="641" data-orig-height="550" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/480e76bfc264ac1c38ac2504c58fe2eb/tumblr_inline_nrvykkEOT91rbfms4_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="641" data-orig-height="550"/></figure><h2><b><a href="http://vidcon.com/speakers/dave-erasmus-founder-of-givey/" target="_blank">Catch Dave talking about 'Giving&rsquo; at VidCon this week!</a></b></h2><p>In order to cover these new transactional and vetting costs and to keep Givey a free platform for projects and charities, we will charge 5% on top of donations made through Givey from 1st August. Rather then deduct the charge from your donation as many sites do, we will add this to your total charged amount. For example a £10 donation will only cost an extra 50p, and will still gain + 25% from Gift Aid (where applicable). Givey will remain completely free for charities and projects to register with and we won&rsquo;t deduct any costs from your donation amount. As a social enterprise striving to do good and make change, we value transparency and hope you understand what has been a difficult decision to make, but it is one that ensures we can keep providing our service and be able to expand globally to help even more people. In order to remain free for users we are also launching a 'fees covered by&rsquo; service which you&rsquo;ll have seen trialled on the site. Businesses can cover the 5% cost and be part of wonderful moments of giving! Get in touch to find out more.</p><h2><b>100% of every donation + Gift Aid will still go to the charity of your choice. We will not deduct the fee from your donation amount.</b></h2><p>Thank you sincerely for your continued support, and we hope you will join us on this next exciting step forwards.</p><p>David Erasmus<br/>Founder &amp; CEO<br/>givey.com</p><p>If you have media requests, enquiries or concerns please contact me directly or email dave@givey.com and I will endeavour to respond accordingly. </p>
