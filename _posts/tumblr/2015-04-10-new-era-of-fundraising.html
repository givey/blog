<p>Today is the day that Givey retires its traditional ‘fundraiser’ page with a totaliser and static format. We’ve just launched our new guide to fundraising on Givey to make sure you’re well equipped to try our new style of fundraising! Its so much more engaging for your supporters and means you can be as creative as you want, or simply start your fundraising by sharing any web link that inspired you to undertake your challenge.</p><p>Find out all you need to know here: </p><p><a href="http://www.givey.com/fundraise" target="_blank">www.givey.com/fundraise</a></p><p>Happy Fundraising!</p><p>Givey</p>
