<p>Givey is lots of things, but technologically it is an API. All the apps and services we build, like <a href="http://www.theburner.co.uk" title="The Burner">The Burner</a>, <a href="http://www.freezeaids.org" title="FreezeAIDS">FreezeAIDS</a> and even <a href="https://www.givey.com" title="Givey">Givey.com</a> are clients of our API. It works with native apps too - our Windows 8 app will be coming out soon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really keen to get developers using it to power their own charity and donation apps. So far we have a <a href="https://github.com/giveydev/givey_rails_sdk">Rails SDK</a> so if anyone is interested in creating an SDK for another language we&rsquo;ll give you all the help we can.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved check out our <a href="http://api-docs.givey.com/">API docs</a> and then email <a href="mailto:philip@givey.com">Philip</a>. </p>
