<p>2014 has borne witness to some truly amazing things as fundraisers and charitable supporters have donated in their thousands to causes that are important to them. You won’t fail to have missed the emergence of new social giving trends such as the infamous ALS Icebucket Challenge and it is with this in mind that we are desperate to tell you about some incredibly exciting changes we are making to Givey!<br/></p><p>Every day we are bombarded with emotive videos, images, stories and article, and we&rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to capture those moments and turn your empathy into a tangible action&hellip;</p><p><b>What’s changing and why is it super idea?</b></p><p>Givey is moving into a new space that will enable you to donate to any charity when you are moved or inspired by something on the web. We are moving away from the traditional fundraiser pages and into a new, expanding area of giving. This means that whether its a photo that has inspired or moved you on Instagram, a compelling video on YouTube, a CHOOOOON on SoundCloud or a self-generated video, Givey is giving you the ability to donate to the charity or cause that interests you, with any form of media you fancy! You will also be able to follow your friends and see what they are donating against, getting to know the content and causes that inspire your buddies too.</p><p>You can of course still &lsquo;fundraise&rsquo; - simply film you and your friends/take a photo/link an article and explain the challenge or activity you are undertaking, and your supporters can 'Givey-share&rsquo; this and donate directly to your cause!</p><figure class=""><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/0fa885d4c9e1c19c13a3bec9c7442500/tumblr_inline_nizpcubb4p1rbfms4.png" alt="image"/></figure><p>In Summary</p><ul><li>Givey is moving into the exciting new world of being able to donate to cause using any content online that&rsquo;s inspired or moved you <br/></li><li>Absolutely no changes will be made to your account and profile<br/></li><li>You will be able to follow your friends and charities you care about, and discover, explore and share the causes that matter<br/></li><li>All existing fundraising pages will continue to run until end of April 2015, after then we will keep them housed safely with us - they just won’t be searchable and you won’t be able to create new pages after this time</li></ul><p>If you FEEL something, actively engage and DO something with Givey! SHARE with your friends and make a real change :)</p><p>We’ll be in touch very soon with how to use the new Givey tool, but in the meantime, get thinking about the content that’s inspired you recently and watch out for the new downloadable Givey app :)</p><p>Thank you so much for using us before, and we can&rsquo;t wait to take you with us on the next step in online giving!</p><p>Love Givey x</p><figure class=""><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/9a844da5e6af4bb95bff9116a3dcac49/tumblr_inline_nizplafq7s1rbfms4.jpg" alt="image"/></figure>
