No Hands campaign.</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><span>At Givey we love technology, and we use it a lot. Between our small team of 7, we own around 30 devices that we use to work, play, speak with friends and family, and of course, give to the causes we care about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So it&rsquo;s a no-brainer for us to support AbilityNet’s Look! No Hands campaign. It’s our chance to say Well Done and Thanks for all the hard work they do - helping over 165,000 people every year to overcome problems and disabilities, so they can confidently use technology to do the everyday things we all take for granted.</span><span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><span>The Look No Hands! campaign aims to increase awareness of the challenges faced by people who find it difficult to use computers. In the spirit of the campaign here’s a little video of me donating to AbilityNet on Givey, using my nose!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Why not </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/abilitynet" target="_blank">visit AbilityNet&rsquo;s profile page</a><span> to join in the fun, </span><span>without using your hands! If you want, you can take a picture of yourself donating via your preferred technique, and add this to your donation!</span></p>
