<p>Givey’s business model is unique in the world of online giving, and it&rsquo;s something we’re incredibly proud of. Because we are completely free for charities we ask corporates and businesses to use our paperless, instant, employee matching tool, meaning we can keep Givey 100% free for our growing community of givers and the charities they support. Whenever a company matches its employees’, we highlight this moment of engagement on the Givey feed and the corporate brand sits alongside these moments of good.</p><figure data-orig-width="685" data-orig-height="553" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/98242de18afe52f88735af25047b310c/tumblr_inline_nnig9avY1T1rbfms4_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="685" data-orig-height="553"/></figure><p>We currently cover all our fees to ensure we remain free for charities and users and rely on enthusiastic, forward thinking businesses to work with us to support their employees. </p><p>If you’d like your company&rsquo;s brand to feature alongside these good news stories, don’t hesitate to get in touch.
