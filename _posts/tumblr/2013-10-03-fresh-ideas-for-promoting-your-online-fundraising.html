<p><span>Since launching our fundraising pages a couple of months ago, some amazing things have happened. Choppy lakes have been conquered, marathon PBs have been destroyed, sweaty bodies have crammed into cars for mammoth road trips, and </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/CROHNSOCSOBER" target="_blank">one impressive chap</a><span> has even given up booze for a month!</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Almost everyone using Givey has smashed their fundraising targets, and here are some of their top tips so you too can raise more money for the causes you care about:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Pick a great photo </strong></p>
<p><span>Adding an image to your fundraising page makes a really big first impression - especially on Givey, where your photo is massive!  Try to choose an image that reflects the cause you’re supporting, like </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/SIMONHGNR2013" target="_blank"><span>this one</span></a><span>; or the challenge you’re embarking upon, like </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/boyvlake" target="_blank"><span>this one</span></a><span>; or it could show your own cheeky face, like </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/roe2ro" target="_blank"><span>this one</span></a><span>. Just please make sure it’s relevant!</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>2. Tell a good story</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Your friends, family and colleagues won’t necessarily donate just because they like you (assuming they do!). These days we’re all busy, probably broke, and distracted by lots of ‘asks’ - so you need to make yours connect. Make sure your fundraising page clearly tells people why you’re supporting your chosen cause, and exactly what you’re doing to raise money - here’s </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/RUN4ARTS" target="_blank"><span>a great example</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>3. Tell people all their money goes to charity!</strong></p>
<p><span>Another bit of feedback our fundraisers tell us, is the importance of Givey not charging a penny in commission. People are sometimes reluctant to give online as they don’t know how much money gets to the charity. With Givey that’s easy - all of it - and telling people this can encourage them to donate.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>4. Send personal emails</strong></p>
<p><span>Once your page is ready, don’t spam people. One of our most successful fundraisers sent a handful of personal emails to his friends and colleagues, before doing a facebook shout out. These emails outlined why he felt each individual would care about his cause - and surprise, surprise, they all sponsored! This also boosted early activity on the fundraising page, helping more people join in over the following weeks when he shared more widely on social networks.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>5. Say thank you. Lots.</strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure you say a big thank you wherever possible to people who support you - in person, in email, on facebook - anywhere and everywhere you can. As one of our fundraisers told us ‘You can’t say thank you enough!’ We’ve got plans to help you do this through the platform soon, as we believe it’s a really important part of fundraising, and we want to help you do it well:)</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>6. Ask your boss to match what you raise.</strong></p>
<p>With Givey, you can ask your boss to match your fundraising. You’ll see this option when you create your fundraising page, and if you select it, your boss will get an email to sign up for <a href="https://business.givey.com/" target="_blank">Givey for Business</a> - where they can set a simple matching rule to support you, and any of your colleagues who also actively support good causes.</p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If you fancy trying a new platform for your fundraising - one that looks great, charges no commission, and can even get your boss to back you - simply </span><a href="https://www.givey.com/" target="_blank"><span>sign up online</span></a><span> to get started!</span></p>
