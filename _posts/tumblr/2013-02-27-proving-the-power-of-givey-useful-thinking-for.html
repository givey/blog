<p>Like most tech start-ups we’re constantly seeking to refine our value proposition, and create spectacular tech to deliver on this. So far, we’ve developed a really powerful tool with the potential to make a massive difference to the world - and you’ll see a lot of activity from us in the months ahead as we release a series of new apps and services.</p>

<p>Behind the tech though, has been a great deal of thinking - hours of ideas, discussions, sketching and scribbling - and we’d like to share three ‘penny drop’ moments incase they’re useful to you.</p>

<p>1. Our power triangle.</p>
<p>Givey exists to build deep relationships between three user groups: charities, givers and businesses. By creating unique shared &amp; shareable moments between these groups, we are able to deliver something very different in the marketplace. Other platforms tend to focus on one or two of these groups only, and so this realisation has helped us define user flows and user experiences that are uniquely valuable. You’ll see these come to life in our new product <a href="http://match.givey.com/" title="Givey Match" target="_blank">Match</a>.</p>

<p>2. Our central process.</p>
<p>Another moment of clarity arrived when we define our core purpose: Givey exists to motivate actions that create value. Identifying the three stages: &lsquo;motivate; action; value&rsquo; has made it easy to link our high level strategy to specific project deliverables. We start with the value we want each new function / app / service to deliver; then we work on an effective and frictionless action to achieve this; then we work through authentic and effective ways to motivate that action. For Givey, the action is always giving (time, money or stuff) - but the motivation and value varies from project to project.</p>

<p>3. Stop the bullshit, and focus.</p>
<p>Once we realised our power triangle, and figured out the motivate / action / value approach, it was really easy to get focused. Our next funding round is September, and we need to prove the value that the Givey people and platform can deliver on. We have focused on 2 or 3 value-types that we want to prove; and our tech, design and marketing teams are working on the motivation and actions to enable this. The number of internal projects we are running has shifted from 12 to around 4, and all the team are focused on the same set of targets.</p>

<p>We’re still learning all the time, but these three chunks have really helped us in the last month or so.
