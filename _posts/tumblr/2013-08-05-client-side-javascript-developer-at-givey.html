<p class="p1">Hello. We&rsquo;d like to work with you at Givey.</p>
<p class="p1">We&rsquo;re looking for someone to help us build robust, rich JavaScript applications that run on top of the Givey API. Maybe you&rsquo;ve built something of note with Backbone.js, or you are actively evaluating frameworks like Angular.js or Ember.js. If not, that&rsquo;s fine, but, JavaScript.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Team</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll sit in between <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pootsbook" title="Philip on Givey" target="_blank">me</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fuselagetown" title="Torunn on Givey" target="_blank">Torunn</a> (not literally, although you can if you want) in assuming responsibility for bridging the server-side API (me) and the product design (Torunn). It would be a bonus if you were a dab hand with HTML5, CSS and a pre-processor like Less or Sass, but not strictly necessary; Torunn is that mythical designer who codes. (She uses Photoshop for… shopping photos!) We both care deeply about quality and usability—we hope you do too—but we&rsquo;re pragmatic enough to ship at the earliest opportunity, improving incrementally.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.givey.com/dave" title="Dave on Givey" target="_blank">Dave</a> is our visionary founder with the big ideas; watch his recent Thinking Digital Talk, &ldquo;<a href="http://vimeo.com/70896490" title="Dave at Thinking Digital" target="_blank">Moments that Matter</a>&rdquo; to get a flavour for Givey&rsquo;s essence. <a href="https://www.givey.com/digates" title="Di on Givey" target="_blank">Di</a> is our marketeer and main contact for product development, often putting us directly in touch with our users, which we love.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Product</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We work on two user-facing applications, <a href="http://www.givey.com" title="Givey" target="_blank">Givey</a> and <a href="http://business.givey.com" title="Givey for Business" target="_blank">Givey for Business</a>. Givey is where you can give to the causes you care about. Givey for Business is where we enable businesses to help their employees do the same. Givey puts its money where its mouth is: <a href="http://www.givey.com/giveybiz" target="_blank"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.givey.com/giveybiz" target="_blank">http://www.givey.com/giveybiz</a></span></a> (Of course, you&rsquo;ll have noticed that the progress bar is slightly off and you&rsquo;re dying to fix it). </p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span>What we value</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">We value people who execute. The waving of hands and expulsion of hot air pale in comparison to working code; even better if it&rsquo;s tested, first. </p>
<p class="p1">We place people above processes and tools. We like to communicate often. We adapt to change in the business. </p>
<p class="p1">Honesty. Transparency. Accountability. Responsibility.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>How we work</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We put our heads together regularly to assess what would be the most valuable use of our time with respect to changing business needs. This is normally every two weeks, and then we have a period of focused execution followed by testing and delivery. And then we do it all again.</p>
<p class="p1">We design responsively. We practice test driven development, continuous integration, continuous deployment; we use, write and contribute to open source.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll get to work with a small and experienced team. It&rsquo;s a good fit if you&rsquo;re looking for an environment to push yourself, you&rsquo;ll have colleagues who are willing to bear with your mistakes. (We like failure, it&rsquo;s the best way to learn. Just don&rsquo;t fail all the time, Okay?)</p>
<p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll be given the time and resources to learn and develop yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll enter an environment of mutual collaboration. No managers here.</p>
<p class="p1">You&rsquo;ll get the tools you need to do the job. (<a href="http://boxen.github.com/" title="GitHub's Boxen" target="_blank">GitHub&rsquo;s Boxen</a> for setting up your development environment on a Mac? YES)</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Details</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you&rsquo;ve got this far then it&rsquo;s only fair that we reward you with a few practical details. Oh, and by the way, it&rsquo;s okay if you think “this is cool, but it&rsquo;s above me”; if the person we are describing is also the person you would like to be, you should get in touch as well.</p>
<p class="p1">This is a full-time position in Givey&rsquo;s Newcastle office.</p>
<p class="p1">This role will command a salary between 18-23k (that&rsquo;s a guide, naturally the right people come at the right price, but we are a startup)</p>
<p class="p1">Send me a personal email at <strong>philip@givey.com</strong> with some details about yourself: projects you&rsquo;ve worked on, exciting things you&rsquo;ve done, boring things you&rsquo;ve done, a link to your GitHub account etc. Anything you feel that best represents your work, and we&rsquo;ll get talking.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Closing date for applications is Wednesday 14th August 2013. Don&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>
<p class="p1">—Philip.</p>
