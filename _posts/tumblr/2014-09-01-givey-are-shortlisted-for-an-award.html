<p class="p1"><span>Givey are thrilled to announce that our partnership with London Midland to create the world’s first instant employee matching website has been shortlisted for the Institute of Internal Communications award for “Most innovative use of media”.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To see our work in internal communications acknowledged on a national stage is a very proud moment for all of us here at Givey, and we’re excited to attend the award ceremony where, if we’re lucky, we may be leaving with official recognition from a great institution. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This honour makes us more driven than ever to deliver the best service we can possibly offer, and we’re excited to help even more companies support the causes their employees care about, just as we have for the brilliant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS9F9YLzwSQ">London Midland</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wish us luck in the awards, and if you’d like your boss to support the charities you love, get them signed up for <a href="https://business.givey.com/">Givey for Business</a> :) </span></p>
