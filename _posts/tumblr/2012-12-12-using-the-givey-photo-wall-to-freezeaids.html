<p>For World <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Day 2012, we worked with charity Chasing Zero to power a national campaign called #FreezeAIDS.</p>
<p>At events around the country, people were encouraged to eat an icecream with a red <span class="caps">AIDS</span> ribbon to show their support for the cause – and to take a photo of themselves in the act.</p>
<p>People then submitted their photos to #FreezeAIDS via <span class="caps">SMS</span>, twitter and online, and these created a real-time digital photo wall that was accessible online and was displayed at the events.</p>
<p>Everyone uploading their photo got a link to make an instant donation to Chasing Zero – and over 20% of people did just that. All donations were captured within the charity’s activity stream on Givey.com meaning photos and stories can now be uploaded and shared out to facebook to raise even greater awareness and create more support for next year.</p>
<p>All donations were processed via Givey meaning everyone who gave also created their own personal Givey account – to keep an ongoing record of all future donations to Chasing Zero or their other favourite charities.</p>
