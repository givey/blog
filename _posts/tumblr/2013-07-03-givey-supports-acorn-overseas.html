<p>Back in April, we decided to open up our homepage to deserving charities who wanted to increase their profile or promote time-sensitive campaigns.</p>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve helped national charities like Ability Net, local charities like North East fund for the Arts, and charities with an overseas focus - like Team Kenya and Global Impact Challenge winners, SolarAid.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the turn of children&rsquo;s charity Acorn Overseas, whose work funds a small children&rsquo;s shelter in Thailand, looking after 45 children who have escaped from the regime in neighbouring Burma. Here&rsquo;s a short video on their work and why you could perhaps support them on Givey.</p>
