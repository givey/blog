Otherwise, its just bit empty. Perhaps my gender enabled me to feel an innate sense of compassion towards the cause; the stats trouble me, its empowering to raise awareness about something that feels achievable (ie. encouraging more women to take up their smear tests) - sure, the prompt came from a barrage of social media coverage and a stream of similar looking selfies but the sentiment and action of giving was all that I really wanted to take part in. its just another reason to give. I don&rsquo;t <i>need</i> that reason to give, but I&rsquo;m more than happy for one to be thrown my way.</p><p>Good team fun, a positive outcome for a charity and no real harm feasible were the 3 big triggers for me. But those weren&rsquo;t enough for the guys. It needed to be personally pertinent - there were many other causes and issues that moved them and they&rsquo;d rather put their cash there.Â </p><p>I totally agree. New Givey in April will enable this. But in the meantime, I&rsquo;m happy to partake, do some good and have a giggle.</p><p>As fascinating as our different reactions were, one thing I think we can be united in, is that freedom to respond to stimulus and digital content is pivotal to linking empathy with a meaningful action.</p><p>I&rsquo;m literally bursting at the seams for the new Givey to come through - for the first time ever, the act of donating and the stimuli will be inextricably linked; whatever that content or cause may be. And that&rsquo;s pretty bloody exciting.</p><p><br/></p><figure class=""><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/0fa885d4c9e1c19c13a3bec9c7442500/tumblr_inline_nj03tcAVhm1rbfms4.png"/></figure>
