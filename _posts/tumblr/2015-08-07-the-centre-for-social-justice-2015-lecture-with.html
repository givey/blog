<p>Lecturing about inequality and the charity sector, a couple of Givey members headed up to Westminster today to hear an announcement from Boris Johnson in partnership with the Centre for Social Justice.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/6f9b8a1262b94bd48326095ad85d7dcc/tumblr_inline_nspvof9xmD1rbfms4_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"/></figure><p>With the extraordinary pay gap between the average employee salary and that of an executive at the same company staggering reaching 130 times more, the top 1% richest of London were highlighted. Britain earns the title ‘Billionaire capital of the world’ as it plays host to roughly 87 billionaires, more than any other country.</p><p>Boris noted that: “The wheels of the economy are turned […] by a greedy nature to consume”, but also that  “human consumption can be a driver of growth.” There is still more to be done, as it is these high-earners that help to afford the services that allow for progression. Boris claimed we need to keep these wheels turning, as “one-nation tories need to go further.”</p><p>Three methods were highlighted by Johnson as necessary to help the country “tolerate” the pay gap; The wealthy to pay tax fairly (currently the top 1% of earners pay 30% of taxes), those on a low income to be “properly and decently rewarded by the firms that can afford to do so”, to earn the ‘London living wage’, and the possibility of change. Promoting the affluent classes, “It’s decades […] since we had bright kids from poor backgrounds bursting down the doors.”</p><p>Highlighted also were three key options to giving people the opportunities they need; Better housing and a future to be economically able to own property, more efficient Transport facilities, and a drive to educate as Boris concluded there was no use in continuing to build a society whereby children aren’t receiving qualifications or creating achievements.</p><p><br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1820" data-orig-width="1856"><img src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/0c228df8b3c46863498cc644d5e5f950/tumblr_inline_nspvqcP5es1rbfms4_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1820" data-orig-width="1856"/></figure><p>In closing, before questions and a bike ride to his next meeting, Boris Johnson concluded the following: “Our society in the last 7 years has become more equal.” Considering the Tories and current position of London as socially progressive, this is a time to “crusade for social Justice” and Boris highlighted a duty from all sectors of society to work with one another.</p>
