<p><span>Over the last few months the Givey team has been beavering away on some shiny new features to make it even easier to support the causes you care about. Here’s a quick update on some of the bits we think you’ll like the best!</span></p>

<p><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-5f1d50dc-7662-825f-66e6-02fe6c222cdd"><span>Fundraising with photos.</span></span></strong></p>

<p>A picture’s worth a thousand words, so we’ve designed what we think is the best-looking, most effective fundraising page ever. Giving and social sharing is as simple as ever, and 100% of all money donated through Givey goes to your charity. We don&rsquo;t take a penny! Whether you are running a marathon or doing a sponsored silence, <a href="https://www.givey.com/" target="_blank">log in to Givey</a> to get started!</p>

<p><strong><span>Get your boss in on the action!</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Whether you&rsquo;re using Givey to make donations or do fundraising, you can now double your money by asking your boss to match donations. <a href="https://business.givey.com/" title="Givey for business" target="_blank">Givey for Business</a> is an easy way for employers to support their team&rsquo;s favourite charities and grow a brand that&rsquo;s loved by the world! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Loads of ways to give.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>And it&rsquo;s now even easier to give to over 8000 charities through Givey. You can give using PayPal or credit card, and can make your donations either through the website, text or twitter. You can also now set up recurring monthly donations to any charity you want!</span></p>
