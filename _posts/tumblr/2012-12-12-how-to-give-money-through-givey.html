<p>Giving money with Givey is easy. </p><p><b>Online:</b></p><p>You can give directly to a charity by hitting the &lsquo;Make Donation&rsquo; button on the charity’s profile page and entering the amount you wish to give.</p>
<p>You can also give to charities that your friends support, by hitting the 'Make Donation&rsquo; button on their personal profile. Money will go to their supported charity.</p>
<p><b>Twitter:</b></p>
<p>And for the more socially minded, you can give to a charity – directly or through your friends – by twitter: </p>
<p>Tweet #<i>GIVEY #[CHARITY OR USER GIVEYTAG] AMOUNT IN POUNDS</i>, e.g. <b><i>‘GIVEY #AMNESTYINT 2’ </i></b>or ‘<b><i>#GIVEY #DAVE 2’</i></b></p>
<p><b>Where does the money go?</b></p>
<p>For every £1 that you donate, 100% of this goes direct to the charity!  We work with PayPal Giving Fund who process every donation through PayPal, claim the Gift-Aid for each donation, and send the payment to each charity.</p>
