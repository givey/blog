<p>A couple of months ago we quietly launched our new fundraising pages. One of the first happy punters to test them out was a good friend of Givey, Simon Hanson, who created a <a href="https://www.givey.com/SIMONHGNR2013">superb page</a> to fundraise for his Great North Run efforts for The Cyrenians. Simon smashed his target within 5 days and is currently standing at 195% of his target!</p>

<p>North East tech treasure Oli Wood also created a <a href="https://www.givey.com/boyvlake">fundraising page</a> on Givey for his epic Boy Vs Lake battle with Lake Ullswater. Again, Oli smashed his target in 4 days and ended up achieving 112% of his target total for St Mary’s Hospice. Oli also used Just Giving, and so was happy to see a space on his Givey page that could link people to donate there if they fancied. </p>

<p>So what is it about Givey’s fundraising pages that seem to incite really rapid donations from friends and family, and end up with fundraising targets getting smashed? The answer lies, we think, across several unique features that are starting to set Givey apart from other online fundraising platforms:</p>

<p>1. Massive pictures.</p>
<p>Givey fundraising pages are about you, not us, so the whole design wraps around an image of your choosing – one that represents your cause or what you’re doing to help. This makes your page completely unique, personal and impactful - and more likely to illicit an immediate and highly engaged response from those who view it.</p>

<p>2. At least 100% of donations go to the charity.</p>
<p>Once your big picture has grabbed people’s attention, the next thing they’ll see is that Givey takes no commission on donations. Unlike most platforms, 100% of all donations through Givey go to charity. This alone can tip the ditherers into action – and it’s so easy to give that they really have no excuse! It can even be more than 100% - see below!</p>

<p>3. Donations can be matched by employers.</p>
<p>Even more unique to Givey is our employee matching engine, <a href="https://business.givey.com/">Givey for Business</a>. This means you can ask your boss to match the money you raise, in return for getting the company logo on your page and in the donation moments you create. Even if your boss says no, everyone who gives will get the same option (to ask their boss, not yours!) – so you can potentially double your donations with no extra effort at all!</p>

<p>4. Easy to share, and plays happily on mobile</p>
<p>And as you’d expect, Givey fundraising pages are really easy to share through facebook and twitter, and it’s just as easy to donate whether you’re on your phone, tablet or desktop. No matter where people come across your page, we make sure it’s really easy for them to support you and the cause you care about.</p>

<p>So if you’ve set yourself any fundraising challenges for this year, or you’re a charity that wants your supporters’ hard-earned pennies to work even harder for you, why not swap your usual donation platform, and give <a href="https://www.givey.com/">Givey</a> a go instead!</p>
