<p>Once you’ve created your Givey Share by uploading a photo or video, start to share it to inspire others to donate! Each time someone donates it will create their own sub-page, but these are all accumulated onto the main ‘Global Page’. This allows others to share for you and inspire more people to support your cause! You’ll be notified every time you’ve inspired someone to donate.</p><p>Check out our Givey Tips below to make sure you’re making the most of Givey&hellip;</p><ul><li><b>Calls to Action</b> are the most critical element of a charity campaign. Making the singular action you want your supporters to take and linking to the donation page is key. Add it to YouTube videos and any other content you create.</li></ul><ul><li>Utilise <b>business contacts</b>. They are often looking for CSR and charity connections to build relationships with. They can also use our matching system to support particular campaigns you run and double your donations!</li></ul><ul><li><b>Celebrity </b>- if you have any high profile friends of the charity, see if they will help spread the word. Reach is really important - the more effort an action involves, the smaller the funnel becomes. Usually a multiplier of x10 works well for this; if 1,000 people see something, 100 are likely to comment, 10  are likely to share or take an action. Don’t underestimate the power of sharing.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Monthly Email </b>- lets us know your key timings and we can feature you on our monthly email to go to our 30,000 user base</li></ul><ul><li><b>Givey Pick</b> - if you&rsquo;re doing something particularly special, let us know and we could feature you as a Givey Pick on the Homepage!</li></ul><ul><li><b>Social Media</b> - spread the word through your networks and run competitions to encourage others to share their good actions!</li></ul><ul><li><b>Show the impact</b> - keep your supporters engaged and up to date so they can see how their money is helping</li></ul><ul><li>Use the <b>Givey logo</b>.
