<p>To achieve this, we need to help you find causes close to your home or close to your heart, so that you can support charities that are relevant to you and the things you care about.</p>
<p>This means supporting charities that are a bit unusual, that are striving to make people&rsquo;s lives better in all sorts of different ways. This is why we want to highlight and support The North East Fund for the Arts - a fund of the Community Foundation in Tyne &amp; Wear - who are experimenting in new and exciting ways to use creativity and the Arts to make people&rsquo;s lives better. Take a look at what they&rsquo;re up to, and if it connects with you in any way, you may like to <a href="https://www.givey.com/" title="North East Fund for the Arts on Givey" target="_blank">make a small donation</a> Thanks!</p>
