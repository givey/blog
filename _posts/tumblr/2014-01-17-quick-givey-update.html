<p>If you&rsquo;d like a heads up on what we&rsquo;ve been up to lately, a couple of things have been published this week that sum up our current status quite nicely.</p>
<p>First off, the first ever corporate giving site powered entirely by the Givey API has been launched by one of the UK’s busiest train companies, London Midland. This is a nice example of the kind of work we&rsquo;re doing to help companies support the causes their employees care about. You can <a href="http://www.fundraising.co.uk/2014/01/17/givey-powers-new-corporate-giving-site-london-midland/" title="Givey powers London Midland Giving." target="_blank">read more about it here</a> or <a href="http://www.londonmidlandgiving.com/" title="London Midland Giving" target="_blank">check out the site here</a>. If you&rsquo;d like your boss to support the charities you love, get them signed up for <a href="https://business.givey.com/" title="Givey for Business" target="_blank">Givey for Business</a>:)</p>
<p>Also available this week is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S40mxXprBqQ" title="Dave Erasmus - the value of giving" target="_blank">Dave&rsquo;s latest TEDx talk</a>. This sums up the Givey story to date - why we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing, and what we hope to achieve. If you like what you hear, and you haven&rsquo;t yet joined our community - why not <a href="https://www.givey.com" title="Givey " target="_blank">sign up online</a> and pick a cause to support. And if you&rsquo;re not following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/daveerasmus" title="Dave Erasmus on YouTube" target="_blank">Dave&rsquo;s exploits on YouTube</a> there&rsquo;s some cool stuff on there involving paint bombs, overseas adventures and ballroom dancing!</p>
