<p>You might already know, but there a few critical values here to us at Givey. One of them is <b>transparency</b>.<br/></p><p>Givey is committed to transparency throughout everything we do.</p><p>We are able to make Givey completely free for users and charities by charging businesses and corporates to use our instant matching engine for employees. This means that there are no registration fees, no monthly charges and no transaction costs for charities or users of Givey.</p><figure data-orig-width="685" data-orig-height="553" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/98242de18afe52f88735af25047b310c/tumblr_inline_nn7vtaeFFD1rbfms4_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="685" data-orig-height="553"/></figure><p>Businesses can meaningfully support their employees with a donation boost every time they give to a charity. It looks like this image above when this happens, and This takes out the admin for the company and really boosts brand reputation. Makes good sense, doesn’t it? We really think so. </p><p>If your business isn&rsquo;t signed up and you’d like them to be, or you run a department and would like to implement a deeper way of engaging your employees and understand the causes they care about, then just drop us a line at sales@givey.com or find out more here: <a href="http://www.givey.com/business" target="_blank">givey.com/business</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1959" data-orig-width="2911"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/f8cd5330d861a40ff7d56abf0a67601b/tumblr_inline_nnkm40bzBl1rbfms4_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1959" data-orig-width="2911"/></figure>
