<p>It&rsquo;s been a busy few months at Givey HQ with the launch of our new <a href="https://business.givey.com/" title="Givey for Business" target="_blank">Givey for Business platform</a>, our badass fundraising pages, and our first ever 48-hour YouTube-powered fundraiser, supported by fashion brand OnePiece.</p>
<p>All these new features are designed to make it easier and more fun to give, and all have been powered by the awesome Givey API, lovingly constructed by our CTO, Nick, star of our much-loved 404-page:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/e8a9dbe89500e72873b435076aabbd4d/tumblr_inline_mr0edlwEam1qz4rgp.png"/></p>

<p><span>However, all good things come to an end, and Nick is now moving on to exciting pastures new, having recently moved with his family to San Francisco. So it&rsquo;s a fond farewell to Nick from all of us at Givey - good luck and thanks for all the fish! You can keep in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/nreavill" target="_blank">Nick on twitter</a> if you&rsquo;d like to follow his stateside antics.<br/></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re delighted to announce that our 404-star is being replaced with a new (albeit similarly bearded) face - that of Philip Poots! Poots has played an increasingly important role on the Givey team in the last six months as our senior developer, working closely with CCO Torunn Skrogstad. He&rsquo;s also leading the expansion of our dev crew, with the <a href="http://blog.givey.com/post/57434572773/client-side-javascript-developer-at-givey" target="_blank">search now on for a front-end javascript developer</a> to join the team. </p>
<p><span>With our giving community and business client base growing daily (touch wood!) we&rsquo;ll be looking to attract more talented folk to the team - around design / development / sales and marketing - so if you&rsquo;re on the hunt for an exciting new opportunity this year - get in touch for a chat!</span></p>
<p><span>And if you haven&rsquo;t had a play with Givey yet - <a href="http://givey.com/" title="social donation platform, givey" target="_blank">sign up</a> to find and support a cause you care about - and let us know what you think!</span></p>
