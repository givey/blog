<p>Joining the #GivingTuesday as a partner, the UK have became the largest country to collaborate since May 2014, and at Givey this season we are getting involved to encourage habitual giving!<br/></p><p>The UKs adoption of #GivingTuesday has been championed by CAF, the Charities Aid Foundation, Blackbaud, and coordinated mostly over social platforms; Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube to provoke conversations about bigger issues. </p><p>Formed from user generated content and fundraisers the UK are aiming to put their money where their mouth is, but having only experienced one previous day of #GivingTuesday, where did it all begin and what can you do to be involved?</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="vimeo" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F127018165"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127018165?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="540" height="304" frameborder="0" title="#GivingTuesday comes to the UK"></iframe></figure><p><br/></p><p>The heritage of #GivingTuesday began in the United States in 2012 to both welcome the winterous season and battle against stereotypical consumerist behaviour where Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday shopping are at the forefront. Now you can be involved with a more meaningful reason for the season and connect with donating as #GivingTuesday bring the opportunity to be part of the solution for causes globally to the forefront.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1366" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/3d2594d896a2e87ed90830dfe4ac926b/tumblr_inline_nybs8fJdZQ1rbfms4_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1366" data-orig-height="768"/></figure><p>On 1st December, Givey are extremely excited to be part of the international movement and to celebrate #GivingTuesday and start the season’s merriment, we are offering you the chance to win £50 for a charity or project of your choice!</p><p><b>All you have to do is take to a social platform; either Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, publically enter your charity&rsquo;s name to @GiveyHQ and tag #Giveyagift and the winner will be picked at random the following day.
