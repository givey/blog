<p>We’re thrilled to be partnering with<b> Circle</b> - a charity committed to giving young people real employment opportunities by developing their skills and helping them take the first steps into life-changing, permanent careers.</p><figure data-orig-width="1260" data-orig-height="527" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/e9d7de72ca51710ac7635c96e9ab463a/tumblr_inline_nmuoghGx4X1rbfms4_540.png" data-orig-width="1260" data-orig-height="527"/></figure><p>Their new YouTube video grittily highlights the challenges and stereotypes faced by young people today, many of whom have a real desire and passion to move into stable, fulfilling roles and really value the coaching and real world experience Circle offers. Check it out and let us know what you think - its linked at the bottom of this post.</p><p>Then&hellip; in true Givey fashion, <b>TAKE ACTION.</b></p><p>Help support Circle’s awe-inspiring work to really make a difference by donating a couple of quid using Givey Share - the tool that means you can show people the content that moved you into action.

It isn’t them, it’s the misconception that society has on what they should be doing with their futures, not what they want.</p><p>Young people like Reuven wants a job in accountancy but he’s stereotyped as having the potential to be a drug dealer. Eniola wants to work in the fashion industry but is told to just have kids and live off benefits; it’s things like this that damage young people’s self-esteem and stop them from living their dreams. This is what is creating the jobless generation and the rise of NEETs is something we all need to work together to fix.</p><p>As you can see from our video, these are just stereotypes, these young people are showing hard work and dedication to get into the field that they want despite everything that has been thrown at them, so lets give them that chance!</p><p>We’ve already trained up 120 young people and got them into their dream jobs, every 8 in 10 young person left our course feeling more confident and over 80% of the young people who took part successfully got jobs of their own afterwards. Eight of our young people have even been promoted to supervisor within the first year of work but there’s still so much more to go. We want NEETs to one day become obsolete; if a person is determined they should be given the chance to work, and that’s exactly what this initiative is about. Take a look at our young people’s profiles and their video CVs and get them into their dream jobs, surely with the sheer determination they have already shown and their competence throughout the video interview yet still not giving up on their dreams it is worth getting these young people into the job they truly deserve.</p><p>On top of that why not share the video with your friends, colleagues, everyone; get the campaign out there, shout about it so the world can understand that young people shouldn’t be denied the chance to work in the profession they have poured their dreams into. You can even donate to the cause, for every £1 you donate, you provide a social value of more than £3, Success is the smile on the young people’s faces when they get jobs. Hear what our previous trainees say about the course here and take a look at our case studies to read about many more of our success stories.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DG5Kvs0fABAA"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5Kvs0fABAA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>
