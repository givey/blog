<p>We’ve found a wonderful example of Unicef using the Halloween holiday spirit to raise invaluable funds for the world’s poorest children; kids who need more than just candy.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="620" data-orig-height="413" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/7a1bc503a3084124668c847b35a38d68/tumblr_inline_nwo2y3r8IG1rbfms4_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="620" data-orig-height="413"/></figure><p><a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/stories/trick-or-treat-unicef-gives-kids-power-change-world/27881" target="_blank">Image Credit</a></p><p>Back in 1947, Reverend Clyde Allison, and his wife Mary Emma wondered if Halloween could become something more than The notion came to them - what if kids could help other kids? Spotting a booth collecting donated goods to Unicef in the aftermath of the second world war, Mary and her kids started painting milk cartons and collecting for Unicef on all Hallow’s Eve - asking for contributions, not candy. Kids helping other kids.The initiative “took off like a prairie wildfire” and by 1953 it became so big, adopted by police stations, church groups and schools, that the US Fund took it over. </p><h2>“My kids have shown more generosity of spirit than many adults I know. On Halloween they went out with their orange UNICEF boxes and raised $113.54 to ‘send to the other children around the world.’ They are still talking about the kids who need medicine and food and water.”</h2><figure data-orig-width="733" data-orig-height="600" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/3f3144eec08517bc2833af938ba02818/tumblr_inline_nwo31yOJcy1rbfms4_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="733" data-orig-height="600"/></figure><p><a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/stories/trick-or-treat-unicef-gives-kids-power-change-world/27881" target="_blank">Image Credit</a></p><p>This year, Unicef have enlisted the help of Snoopy and the gang to make the camapign bigger than ever. Their story is a phenomenal one, and when you consider it costs just $5 (about £3.25) to feed a malnourished child for 5 days, the necessity and poignance of the campaign is starkly apparent. Taking a holiday season known for its excess and harnessing good will to help those in need is a shining example of human goodness, and one we really support.</p><h2>#GiveyaTreat</h2><p>Taking a little inspiration from Unicef’s 65-year old Halloween campaign, Givey is launching its very own<b> #giveyatreat</b> initiative this year for the first time. We’ll donate to a randomly selected charity every day this week when they tweet us @GiveyHQ and use the <b>#giveyatreat</b> hashtag.
