This video, posted yesterday by Youtube Spotlight, has already reached over 100,000 views, and the combined total of views for all the #LaughLearnGive videos will no doubt reach the millions, giving traditional media outlets a run for their money in terms of sheer numbers. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Moreover, with the rise of text giving and social donation sites as our own, it&rsquo;s never been easier to give to the causes you care about, and the annotations on Youtube videos can take you from watching an inspiring video to donating to the cause it&rsquo;s highlighting in a matter of seconds. </p>
<p class="p1">In the future, with the continued rise of social media sites such as Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter, social giving is set to become an even bigger part of events such as Comic Relief. Hopefully in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see more and more innovative uses of viral video raising awareness for causes that deserve our attention, and as sites such as ours help streamline and refine the way social giving works, we&rsquo;ll all see more and more money going to causes that matter every year.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re planning on giving to Comic Relief this year, you can do so through your favourite social donation site <a href="https://www.givey.com/comicrelief" target="_blank">right here</a></strong></p>
